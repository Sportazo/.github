## Overview
Sportazo is the future of blockchain based sports videoclips. Similar to Unsplash, but with sports videos instead of images, and being able to sell them. Imagine being able to assist to a soccer match, record an amazing clip, display and sell it online.

### Problem and Opportunity

There are several reasons why I decided to create this project, which involve a lack of video focus sports marketplaces in the Web3 industry. There is also a huge gap of opportunity for video creators who assist to sport games to have a Web3 niche. Hosting video clips online can be really expensive for new companies, so a solution to have more efficient video transcoding is required. There is a big growth to bring more of the sports fanbase into the blockchain community.

### Solution

The solution for this problem is my proposal, Sportazo. A platform specifically focused on sports videoclips recorded by the community, for the community.
It uses the technology of Livepeer Studio in order to have an efficient video transcoding. The creators and collectors will have an amazing experience that will keep them engaged in the platform.

### Features
* Ideal for collectors who enjoy keeping the memory of different sports matches.
* Perfect for creators who already take professional sports pictures, or who might start doing it as a hobby while earning money.
* Scalable solution to the expensive infrastructure video solutions.
* Collections: A group of videoclips that belong to the same category. Anyone can create a collection.
* Albums: Buy stamp packs to finish the complete album. Only by invitation to create album.

### Competition
There is no platform on the market that has the same aim as Sportazo. It is a combination of Unsplash, Panini sticker album and Opensea. This is the reason why it could potentially be a positive implementation to the Web3 industry.

### Why use Livepeer?
The use of videoclips in the platform is the main attraction so it is important to ensure that resources are used to keep the transcoding cheap.
There are currently 5172 delegators ensuring the network so the project is here to stay for the long run.
