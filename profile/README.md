Next Video Build Hackathon by Encode

## Overview
Sportazo is the future of blockchain based sports videoclips. Similar to Unsplash, but with sports videos instead of images, and being able to sell them. Imagine being able to assist to a soccer match, record an amazing clip, display and sell it online.

There are several reasons why I decided to create this project, which involve a lack of video focus sports marketplaces in the Web3 industry. There is also a huge gap of opportunity for video creators who assist to sport games to have a Web3 niche. Hosting video clips online can be really expensive for new companies, so a solution to have more efficient video transcoding is required. There is a big growth to bring more of the sports fanbase into the blockchain community.
